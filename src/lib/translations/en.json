        "span2": "My background is in full-stack web development, with hands-on experience in Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. I’ve worked extensively with Angular and AngularJS to build user-friendly, dynamic applications. More recently, I’ve started diving into C# and Flutter to broaden my skill set and explore new areas of development.",

I'm known for being creative, detail-oriented, and solution-focused, which led to me taking on additional responsibility for UI quality assurance in my previous role. That also meant close collaboration with designers, product owners, and business analysts, which I genuinely enjoyed.",
